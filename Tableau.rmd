## Summary
THis baseball dataset is provided by Udacity to create a Tableau story. 

In my Tableau workbook, visualizations have been created to answer the following questions:
1. Diference between different handedness players in batting average and home runs.
2. Effect of height and weight on the performance.
3. Relationship between batting average and home runs.

## Design:
1. The first part of the story is to show the number of players of each handedness and the distribution of batting average and home runs of each handedness. At first, a pie chart is used to show the percentage of each handedness. After receiving the feedback from my roommate, a table of number of players is added.
2. The second part to show the relationship between batting average and the player's weight and height. At first, a scatter plot is created to show the relationship. My roommate said the scatter plot is not clear compared with a line chart with average batting average over the weight and height. Therefore, a chart combined a histogram and line graph with two y axes is created to show the relationship.
3. The same design reason is adopted when develop the third part of the story to show the relationship between the home run and the player's weight and height. 
4. A combined chart is created to show the relationship between the home runs and batting average. 


## Feedbacks:
1. "It would be much clearer to show the total number of players and the number of each handedness rather than only a percentage on a pie chart".

2. "The scatter plot cannot show a clear pattern in your story. You can try to combine the count of players of different weight and their average batting average. You have to create a weight bin to do this."
